## Behind the Scenes: Building a Portfolio That Feels Like “Me”

Creating a portfolio is more than collecting your work — it’s deciding how you want people to see you. For a long time, I struggled with that. Should it be minimal? Bold? Playful? Professional?

Eventually, I realised the answer was simple: it should feel like me.

I started by looking at the techniques I enjoy most: motion design, photography, visual storytelling. Then I built the layout around those strengths. The big typography, the black-and-white contrast, the energetic hints of color — all of it reflects how I approach creativity.

A portfolio will always grow and evolve, but this version feels honest. It shows not only what I can make, but how I think. And that is the part I’m most proud of.
