## Finding My Creative Voice Through Motion Design

Motion design has always fascinated me — the idea that simple shapes, photos or illustrations can come alive with timing and rhythm feels almost magical. When I created my first animation, I realised how much control motion gives you over atmosphere, storytelling and emotion.

What I enjoy most is experimenting. A transition might start as a mistake, a texture might come from a completely unrelated photo, and an animation curve might change the entire mood of a scene. Motion design is where creativity meets problem-solving, and that combination keeps me inspired every day.

This project taught me not to fear the blank canvas. Animation isn’t about perfection — it’s about exploring movement, refining details and slowly discovering your own visual language.
